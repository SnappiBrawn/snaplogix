- comment: We wanted a file storage application to maintain all our digitized records. We approached Snaplogix to build this software for us. Within 2 months they delivered the application and we had started storing and organizing our documents. They have also promised up prolonged support for any future requirements we might have.

- comment: Ghatstays has been my life's journey for the last 3 years now and Snaplogix has definitely played a major role in building it from the ground up. They understood our vision precisely and were more than happy to accomodate a ton of last minute changes, thanks to my indecisiveness.
